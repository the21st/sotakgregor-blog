# The Value of a Clean Git Commit History

A clean git commit history isn't about neatness or vanity. It's a tool that improves code reviews and the long-term maintainability of a project. The methods to achieve a clean history can be complex, but here I want to focus on _why_ a clean history within a PR matters.

## Better Code Reviews

A clean commit history simplifies reviews. When commits are well-scoped and logically organized, reviewers can understand changes quickly and provide useful feedback.

- When each commit captures a single conceptual change, reviewers can follow the evolution of code step-by-step instead of wading through unrelated changes. Mixing multiple concepts across commits increases the mental effort required to review. By grouping related changes together, you reduce this cognitive burden.
- Don't waste your reviewer's time by showing them all your failed experiments in your Git history. A polished history omits failed experiments. Showing every trial-and-error step wastes reviewers' time. When they see only the final implementation, reviewers can focus on the intent and quality of the code rather than its development process.
- A good commit has both a title and a _description_, explaining the “why” behind a commits. This helps build a story for your PR, and people love stories.

Well-structured commits mean reviewers spend less time figuring out what changed and more time assessing how well it was done. **And good commits that explain themselves make it much more likely for you to get a good review!** Every good review is an opportunity to grow as a developer.

### What about small PRs?

If your PR is small enough that as a whole, it’s basically the size of 1 good commit, then I recommend squashing all your commits into one before asking for a code review! Why confuse your reviewer with a list of commits showing your incremental work?

## Long-term Code Understanding

The value extends beyond immediate reviews. Codebases evolve over years, and developers often revisit old changes to debug or enhance features.

Good commit messages and descriptions, paired with focused commits explain why changes were made, not just what was changed. This historical context becomes invaluable when trying to understand code written months or years ago, especially when the original authors are no longer available.

## Conclusion

Maintaining a clean git history pays off: it makes code reviews more efficient and creates a maintainable codebase where future developers can confidently navigate the project's history. It transforms Git from a version control tool into a narrative of your software's evolution.

Treating your git history as part of your code's documentation is one of the simplest yet most effective ways to improve your development workflow – both for yourself and your teammates.
